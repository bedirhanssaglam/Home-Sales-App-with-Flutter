# house_shop

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

First of all, there are four main builds in our lib folder. These are models, provider, widgets and core structures.

**- core: Here besides our screens we have a simple extension and a routes folder for navigation.**

* **models:** Here we have a model class to help us for the 'Chat' screen in the application.

* **provider:** Here, there is a provider structure for the PageView and BottomNavigationBar in the application to be more efficient.

* **widgets:** In this folder, there are CustomWidgets specially created to be used in various parts of the application.
